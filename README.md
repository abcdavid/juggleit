JuggleIT!

A java application which allows you to create and edit ladder diagrams for juggling patterns.  A simple animation is used to demo the results.

Allows for multiple jugglers, so passing patterns can be explored.

Siteswaps can be entered, e.g. Try entering 531441531441333

Use Drag and Drop to connect points.  The arrows represent throws.

./build to compile

./juggleit to launch

This was written many moons ago, so is not up to date with the latest Java version.  Compilation therefore gives many warnings.

Uses antlr for the parser which reads patterns saved to file. See https://antlr.org/

Tested on java version "11" 2018-09-25 on MacBook Air
